# Data structures and algorithms

This repository contains examples of data structures and algortihams from my collage class.

## Sorting algorithams

Here are the sorting algorithms learned and their complexity in big O notation.

| Algorithm | Complexity (average) |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| Quick sort | O(n*log(n)) |
| Bubble sort | O(n^2) |
| Selection sort | O(n^2) |
| Merge sort | O(n*log(n)) |
| Insertion sort | O(n^2) |
| Heap sort | O(n*log(n)) |

## Data structures

Here are the data structures learned.

| Data structure |
| -------------- |
| Singly linked list |
| Doubly linked list |
| Stack |
| Queue |
| Hash table |
| Binary search tree |

## Basic algorithams on graphs

Here are the algorithams on grpahs learned.

| Algoritham |
| ---------- |
| Breadth-first search |
| Depth-first search |
| Dijkstra's algorithm |
| A* algorithm |
